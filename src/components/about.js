                            I trained the model on positive and negative articles, so technically there is no "mixed" sentiment category. However
                            I determined the cut off heuristically based on a set of 50 oil and gas articles that I ran through the model.
                         <br />
                            A score greater than 0.7 is positive, a score less than 0.3 is negative, and in between is mixed.
                         <br />
                            The downloadable dataset includes the raw sentiment scores, and the sentences that they are based on. Feel free to creat your own models to re-calculate the sentiment of each article.
